studies of specific firms of empirical data to models towards process rather than The behavioral approach takes the firm as the basic unit of It attempts to predict behaviour with respect to output and resource allocation It emphasizes the The theory argues that while small firms may operate under the guidance of the such a simple model does not describe larger These larger firms are coalitions of individuals or which may include suppliers and so According to Cyert and these groups participate in setting goals and making Priorities and information may vary by potentially creating Cyert and

that real firms aim at satisficing rather than maximizing their some groups may settle for achievements rather than striving for the best possible This came from a concept known as bounded which was

critic J√ºrgen Habermas conducted by various European media in the The common thread of the interviews is disagreement with resurgent German nationalism after the reunification with the former German Democratic Republic theoretical works are in the background of the At the time of the in the early Habermas was publishing Between Facts and his philosophy of law and and writing the philosophical essays which would later be collected in the volumes published in English as Justification and Application and The Inclusion of the In A Berlin Habermas wages an intellectual campaign in political public sphere against what he sees as the influence of German political theorist and proponent of Carl and the philosopher Martin Schmitt advocated a view of German whereby Communism and Nazism would be and the continuity of a reunified Germany with her past would be Habermas encourages Germans to think differently about 1945 and In Germany must reject any thought of basing her reunified future on a continuation of notions such as German ethnic identity as a foundation for the German Germany as a potential political and military power in central an foreign and the notion of a for Germany separate from that of other Western The rationale Habermas gives is initially Germans face squarely their they cannot wish for any continuity with it that does not own it as tragic and This harks back to his earliest writings of the collected in in which he sees the only way forward for a German philosophy is to remember the philosophy that was obliterated in the Beyond are two considerations that for Habermas loom The first concerns the process of in all its worldwide transnational systemic impacts of human activity on the natural unprecedented dramatic improvements in transportation and communication and international Habermas agrees with British theoretical sociologist Anthony Giddens that globalization transforms the nature of politics and Although the in the 18th and 19th centuries an appropriate location and scale for the development of an emancipated political public by the aftermath of World War II this was no longer the As problems are global their solutions be as only a global scale of is and the foreign affairs of nations must all be seen as the domestic affairs of the global Based on his theoretical notion of societal legitimacy coming only from the ongoing consent of the Habermas shows how his notion of a political public sphere by means of the deliberative agreements developed in radical liberal a way for people who formerly considered themselves strangers can come to see themselves as having a common at a larger social scale than they had previously The second larger consideration for Habermas is the supplanting of what he calls for ethnic nationalism as the substantial glue holding a pluralistic society In a worldview pluralism means that people cannot base agreements at a political level on particular religious in an age of immigration and retreating it is no longer appropriate to build political consensus in the state primarily upon one values over the only way forward is to expand the emancipatory potential already present even in or democratic that people come by practice to see that their own interests are best safeguarded in procedural systems of law and politics that systematically protect the interests of all A dedication to such a system is what Habermas means by as elaborated particularly in the essays later published as The Postnational A Berlin Romance is a 1956 East German romantic drama film

Pictured are Uschi and with hairstyles and clothing evoking the Golden Age of Hollywood The film is one of the strongest critiques of consumer culture in Germany in the 1950s in the aftermath of World War in his Americanization and The German Encounter with American Culture After argues that connection between bourgeois and individualism and the ethos of socialism became increasingly politicized after the Second World He claims consumerist fantasies between the west and the eastern sectors of Berlin increased as the city being masculinized as a direct result of the American influence in the capital and the legacy of Hollywood film such as James He argues that the rather that being an advert for West is in fact a critique of Americanization in the western side of the and that American masculine influences weakened traditional senses of authority in both public and domestic and typical Klein and Kohlhaase evoke the Americanization of East Berlin through their relationship to modern mass The in this can therefore be seen as the struggle of West German men in the city in a changing society with new pressures and influences brought about by the Americanization of the stern parents

directly provide a negative instruction to young people in the east to move to the west where life is depicted as Despite Klein and Kohlhaase collaborated again the following year with another realist film Sch√∂nhauser Corner which was a greater success at the than A Berlin These two films are regarded as the most accurate insights into the East Berlin youth scene in the aftermath of World War II and were a considerable success amongst the The films have been described as a more open engagement with American youth and playing a role in the rituals of protest shared by urban youth in East and West The film was praised by newspapers such as BZ am Junge Welt and Berliner Zeitung for its accurate representation of urban culture in contemporary life in Berlin in the that it showed people as they really some East German papers criticized the film for not providing an effective counter response to notions that the East is bland and boring in comparison to the glamour of the Horst Knietzsch of Neus Deustchland believed that the matters of the divided could have been dealt with much more effectively by Klein and Kohlhaase and by being more assertive in their depictions of the positive and

her assistant Betty discuss situation with the Lovely is sick and tired of being subjected to the of people in town and being pointed Lovely brings up that Colonel Fainwell had promised her freedom from her situation and mentions that she likes the Colonel above all the men she has ever method of obtaining consent is to assume the identity of the ideal gentleman to each Since he has no chance in obtaining consent as himself from all four guardians he is forced to get consent The Colonel only needs to deceive each guardian long enough to receive consent to marry Anne Lovely while disguised as the ideal Colonel Fainwell shows up at the park dressed nicely to impress Sir Philip with a few footmen to show Fainwell is supposedly dressed in a French style which attracts the attention of Sir Philip as Colonel approaches Once they begin to one the woman sitting with Sir Philip leaves and the Colonel says everything that Sir Philip wants to Sir Philip gives his consent and they arrange for Fainwell to be introduced personally to the other three At Obadiah Prim and Anne Lovely argue about choice of Prim saying it is too Lovely argues back saying Prim is a prude and a believer of Quaker to Quaker Prim enters and states that breasts are too exposed and that she should hide them with a also stating that it inflames desire in other Lovely is upset and declares that her father never meant the tyranny of guardianship to control her while Prim defends himself by stating that all he meant was to prevent her from wearing temping attire and provoking others to Sir Philip and Fainwell arrive at house and Fainwell is introduced to Prim formally for the first Then he is introduced to Lovely and as he goes to kiss her he attempts to give her a letter which she drops and Prim picks After Fainwell reveals to Lovely who he really Lovely realizes she had made a mistake refusing his She snatches the letter away from Prim and shreds it before anyone can take it back from The other guardians arrive and Fainwell is introduced to Periwinkle and Both guardians question Colonel determine that they disapprove of Sir and leave declaring their requirement that all of their personal qualifications be PointsWe see in this act that Sir Philip is a He has very big interests in Fashion and is made to believe the Colonel is a higher figure than he really The Colonel plays every card he knows to mirror Sir personality to make them seem to to have but one for our ideas and conceptions are the Scene In the next we see how Lovely rejects Quaker strictures and notions of and characteristics are revealed even more when the point about romance between Quakers is accepted even with temptation being but if they are not it is evil and is looked down It is reconfirmed that the disapproval of the other guardians is as each fails to see the Colonel as one of his own Act three starts with Sackbut congratulating Colonel Fainwell for obtaining the consent of at least one of the The Colonel is in an Egyptian disguised as a to meet Periwinkle is intrigued by not only the foreign appearance of but also the antique the Colonel Periwinkle asks Fainwell if he has collected any as odd trinkets capture his even asking if had a Fainwell plays it off saying that he possesses more worthy knowledge than would be shown by possession of such petite He claims that he has great knowledge of the more than what Descartes has claimed to discover and find With Periwinkle astonished and Fainwell lists a slew of items with claims of outrageous things they can He finishes off the list with a typical girdle claiming it has the power to make the wearer invisible and able to teleport Fainwell explains that in order for the girdle to the others in the room must face After the explanation Periwinkle tries on the Fainwell and Sackbut turn towards the and when they turn they pretend that Periwinkle Not Periwinkle requests that the Colonel try the girdle Fainwell agrees and when Periwinkle and Sackbut turn Fainwell hides underneath a trap door so that when Periwinkle turns the illusion of invisibility is played After the Sackbut raises a point saying that if Periwinkle would purchase the girdle and use he would be able to travel as he always wanted The Colonel says that the girdle would never change ownership for money and reveals that the point of his trip is to find the guardians of Lovely and win their consent in his marriage The first guardian to give consent would receive the and Periwinkle declares that he is one of the four guardians of Right when the agreement is to be signed and a drawer of the tailor reveals to Periwinkle that the foreigner is actually Colonel ruining Fainwell flees immediately and Freeman enters to set forth the backup Freeman informs Periwinkle that his uncle is dying and suggests that he make a trip to the estate despite it being far Periwinkle thanks and the Colonel and Sackbut with the plan of going after the next PointsFainwell is dressed up as a foreigner armed with a item that is so intriguing to Fainwell could demand anything and would likely receive Strangely the item Fainwell uses is called meaning mousetrap for a fool in Periwinkle is indeed a fool and is easily manipulated into believing the He is also a fool for easily believing the disguised Fainwell was the nephew of his admirer John Act four opens at the Exchange Alley where all the stock action takes place with Tradelove looking Freeman enters with Fainwell disguised as a Dutch trader with news saying the Spanish had raised their siege of The note states that no one would know right but in a few hours it will go public and this would be the perfect opportunity to make Tradelove and Freeman both make transactions that they think will bear and Freeman mentions to Tradelove that the Colonel has no idea of the potential opportunity Tradelove insists that the siege has been raised while Fainwell holds his end maintaining that it has Tradelove lays down a money With the bet Fainwell and Freeman make it back to Tavern to plan for opening with his dying Before they get Sackbut enters with a letter addressed to introducing him to Simon a Quaker Fainwell plans on impersonating this Simon Pure to try to secure consent from Sackbut prepares Quaker clothes and also provides the country dress Fainwell is to wear as the steward of Tradelove shows up at the tavern seeking Fainwell disguised as the steward sneaks Freeman meets with Tradelove who immediately brings up that the letter Freeman received earlier was a Tradelove loses the bet he made with Fainwell at the exchange and is unable to pay Freeman suggests that Tradelove offer his consent to marry off Anne Lovely without mentioning to the Colonel that he would still require the consent of the other three Tradelove agrees to this proposal and tells Freeman to ask the to accept this proposal in satisfaction of the two thousand pounds The scene shifts to the Colonel disguised as the steward at house informing him of his Fainwell now as sobs in between lines to make it seem like the death greatly impacts his Fainwell brings up the contents of the and lastly mentioning lease needs to be renewed with the approval of Periwinkle and as he inspects the pen Fainwell hands Fainwell switches the lease for the consent contract and Periwinkle signs the consent form With the form in Fainwell leaves house and returns to the tavern where Freeman and Tradelove are Before the Colonel has a chance to make an Tradelove praises the generosity of the Dutch trader for accepting the proposal of his consent for marriage in lieu of the two thousand pound The now dressed as the Dutch enters and secures the deal for with Sackbut and Freeman as witnesses of the Tradelove claiming he will put in a good word with the other guardians as he made the Dutch trader believe he was the main man in charge of Anne marriage On way he is thinking that he has bested the Dutch gaining relief for his debt at the small price of his consent for a still impossible PointsTradelove is seen to admire Dutch claiming they know stocks and trade best of all and yet he makes a wager with confidence against the Colonel based on the letter Freeman shows He shows his cocky hoping to finally outwit a Dutch and his trust in Freeman by accepting the information in the After Tradelove finds out about his he offers consent for the trader to marry Lovely in lieu of his He emphasizes that he is the leader of all the guardians in charge of marriage saying that he would not give up the consent The deceit is played out and accepted by the making Tradelove feel like a winner when in reality he is the At all goes according to Fainwell acts as if the death was a true tragedy to help prove that the circumstances are He brings up the lease signing to get a signature one way or switching it with the consent contract to secure Anne Lovely from The arrival of Simon letter was not originally in the plans and represents a godsend for an opportunity to win consent to marry Anne The act starts at house with Prim and Anne Lovely arguing over choice in Lovely declares that she wishes to dress in whatever fashion she desires and claims that Prim would have never attracted any man with the way she Prim counters that she did indeed attract many men while properly she is too familiar with wicked The guardians all enter and all claim that they have found a husband for As each a different guardian shoots the candidate unbeknownst to each candidate being the same Prim is the only one without a candidate to marry which changes quickly when a servant announces that Simon the Colonel in has The Colonel enters in a outfit as Lovely and Prim to greet the As Lovely Fainwell cannot help but stare at Prim notices this and asks why Fainwell to which he responds that he had a dream and saw Lovely in Prim interprets this as Lovely being converted and leaves with Prim to have Fainwell convert Lovely so she will become a faithful Lovely does not recognize Fainwell in his Quaker disguise and shrieks when he approaches her Fainwell reveals his identity to calm her Due to the Prim but Lovely explains she shrieked because of blabber about converting her into a Prim exits once again to leave Fainwell and Lovely Fainwell explains to Lovely that he has the consent of the other three guardians and only needs to marry Lovely plays along with faking that she has indeed converted to a Prim is convinced that Lovely is Then a servant enters and informs Prim that the real Simon Pure has Once Simon Pure has deception holds because a counterfeit letter is brought stating that there would be an imposter dressed as a Quaker with a mob to rob and kill Fainwell accuses Simon of being the imposter and Lovely adds on saying that she saw Simon with said convincing Prim to dismiss the real Simon Fainwell realizes his time under cover is so he acts quickly and explains that Lovely would not be left alone by the Sathan and Lovely displays attitudes as if the spirits have filled Prim gives his consent for Fainwell to marry Lovely and signs the only for Simon to return with proof of his Since Fainwell has obtained the he no longer has any reason to deceive anyone anymore and admits that he was the false Simon All the guardians enter with Freeman and realize that they have all been deceived as Fainwell exposes his many identities to disguise as a Quaker admits him to the household of Prim and wins acceptance from him and his After Lovely discovers his her acting helps persuade Prim that she has been hence the speedy consent The counterfeit letter that mentions an imposter could have gone both With aggression and Simon is forced to and he is gone long enough

in 1990 by The Orwell to the journalist Bob A Brief History of Blasphemy was widely praised in the immediate aftermath of the controversy over The Satanic Some reviewers suggested that Webster shows

History of Chinese Fiction is a book written by Lu Xun as a survey of traditional Chinese It was first published in Chinese in translated into and then into English in 1959 by Gladys Yang and Yang It was the first survey of Chinese fiction to be published in and has been influential in shaping later The coverage extends from early myths and legends through the zhiguai stories of the Six the chuanqi stories of the Tang and Song the vernacular stories of the following and late Qing The scholar John Wang finds the study is still and in providing a strong interpretive framework and detailed presentations of many previously neglected but also that it has obvious such as overemphasis on early forms of not enough coverage of later such as the bianwen and vernacular short 1920 Peking University invited Lu Xun to give a course on the history of Chinese A draft version based on his lecture notes was issued in two parts in 1923 and then in a combined volume in which was reprinted five Lu Xun revised it for publication in The work was quickly translated into then over the following decades into Japanese then into and the international lists 175 editions in Chinese and Japanese published from 1925 to 2012 and 54 editions in English from 1959 to widely held works by Xun Lu list is not Hegel in review of scholarship on Chinese notes that Lu Xun had less than the complete corpus of classical Chinese available to and there were many items to which he did not have The dominant genres of the the bianwen and he had only begun to be rediscovered and few readers understood their historical Hegel concludes that Lu critical insights into individual works remain but Brief still is far from sufficient as an introduction to the field seventy years John Wang praises Brief History for being both in design and minute in Later discovery of new materials meant there are gaps to be filled and conclusions to be but bold outline had been drawn and a sound methodology Before Brief there was little discussion of fiction in Chinese studies of for extensive discussion of genres and works of one had to turn to foreign works such as Herbert History of Chinese Literature or a survey in Japanese by Sionoya On Lu approach balanced presentation of historical the the and the work The solid scholarship is all the more impressive because earlier neglect of the subject made it difficult to establish and The Chinese version includes references to the primary and secondary which are not included in the English of its persuasive interpretation and clear Brief History is still the starting point even for many scholars who do not agree with For Professor Gu Ming Dong writes that a holds that Chinese fiction reached only in the Tang for view has been generally considered The argument in Brief History is that the stories were composed fictional youyi zuo while the Tang chuanqi tales were composed wei Gu points out that Lu distinction grew from one made by Hu a literary theorist in the Qing who stressed Professor Gu points out that authorial intention is difficult to establish and that authors may have tried to hide He goes on to take Lu Xun to task for underestimating writers who recognized the need for factuality but wanted to take advantage of their powers of fictitious The zhiguai tales of the Six Dynasties may have been scraps left over when the standard histories were There has been disagreement on other Wilt for was among the first to disagree with Lu explanation that the huaben of the Song dynasty were or at least printed versions of used

discusses the genes responsible for some human including red earwax and lactose Racial classification is shown to be a scientifically invalid The genome encodes a huge number of characteristics that differ from person to which far outnumber the physical differences between black and white Rutherford concludes that genetics cannot be used to define Francis Galton and his contribution to the

the Big Bang to Black Holes is a book on theoretical cosmology by English physicist Stephen It was first published in Hawking wrote the book for readers who had no prior knowledge of In A Brief History of Hawking writes in technical terms about the development and eventual fate of the which is the object of study of astronomy and modern He talks about basic concepts like space and basic building blocks that make up the Universe as and the fundamental forces that govern it as He writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black He discusses two major general relativity and quantum that modern scientists use to describe the he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the Universe in a coherent The book became a bestseller and sold more than 25 million in Hawking first approached Simon the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University with his ideas for a popular book on Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to With some he persuaded Hawking to drop all but one The author himself notes in the acknowledgements that he was warned that for every equation in the the readership would be hence it includes only a single E The book does employ a number of complex and other illustrations to detail some of the concepts that it A Brief History of Stephen Hawking explains a range of subjects in including the Big black holes and light to the His main goal is to give an overview of the but he also attempts to explain some complex In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a Universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of The 2017 edition of the book contained twelve whose contents are summarized In the first Hawking discusses the history of astronomical particularly ancient Greek philosopher conclusions about spherical Earth and a circular geocentric model of the later elaborated upon by the Greek astronomer Hawking then depicts the rejection of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic model and the gradual development of the currently accepted heliocentric model of the Solar System in the and 18th first proposed by the Polish priest Nicholas Copernicus in validated a century later by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei and German scientist Johannes Kepler proposed an elliptical orbit model instead of a circular and further supported mathematically by English scientist Isaac Newton in his 1687 book on Principia In this Hawking also covers how the topic of the origin of the Universe and time was studied and debated over the the perennial existence of the Universe hypothesised by Aristotle and other early philosophers was opposed by Augustine and other belief in its creation at a specific time in the where time is a concept that was born with the creation of the In the modern German philosopher Immanuel Kant argued again that time had no In American astronomer Edwin discovery of the expanding Universe implied that between ten and twenty billion years the entire Universe was contained in one singular extremely dense This discovery brought the concept of the beginning of the Universe within the province of Currently scientists use Albert general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics to partially describe the workings of the while still looking for a complete Grand Unified Theory that would describe everything in the In this Hawking describes the development of scientific thought regarding the nature of space and He first describes the Aristotelian idea that the naturally preferred state of a body is to be at and which can only be moved by implying that heavier objects will fall Italian scientist Galileo Galilei experimentally proved theory wrong with by observing the motion of objects of different weights and concluding that all objects would fall at the same This eventually led to English scientist Isaac laws of motion and laws implied that there is no such thing as absolute state of rest or absolute space as believed by whether an object is or depends on the inertial frame of reference of the Hawking then describes Aristotle and belief in absolute time can be measured accurately regardless of the state of motion of the Hawking writes that this commonsense notion does not work at or near the speed of He mentions Danish scientist Ole discovery that light travels at a very high but finite speed through his observations of Jupiter and one of its moons Io as well as British scientist James Clerk equations on electromagnetism which showed that light travels in waves moving at a fixed Since the notion of absolute rest was abandoned in Newtonian Maxwell and many other physicists argued that light must travel through a hypothetical fluid called its speed being relative to that of This was later disproved by the showing that the speed of light always remains constant regardless of the motion of the Einstein and Henri Poincar√© later argued that there is no need for aether to explain the motion of assuming that there is no absolute The special theory of relativity is based on arguing that light travels with a finite speed no matter what the speed of the observer Mass and energy are related by the famous equation E which explains that an infinite amount of energy is needed for any object with mass to travel at the speed of A new way of defining a metre using speed of light was can also be described by using light a spacetime graphical representation that restricts what events are allowed and what are not based on the past and the future light A spacetime is also in which and are intrinsically The motion of an object through space inevitably impacts the way in which it experiences general theory of relativity explains how the path of a ray of light is affected by which according to Einstein is an illusion caused by the warping of in contrast to view which described gravity as a force which matter exerts on other In spacetime light always travels in a straight path in the but may appear to curve in space due to gravitational These paths are The twin a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical considers that twins can age differently if they move at different speeds relative to each or even if they lived in different locations with unequal spacetime Special relativity is based upon arenas of space and time where events take whereas general relativity is dynamic where force could change spacetime curvature and which gives rise to a expanding Hawking and Roger Penrose worked upon this and later proved using general relativity that if the Universe had a beginning a finite time ago in the then it also might end at a finite time from now into the In this Hawking first describes how physicists and astronomers calculated the relative distance of stars from the In the 18th Sir William Herschel confirmed the positions and distances of many stars in the night In Edwin Hubble discovered a method to measure the distance using the brightness of Cepheid variable stars as viewed from The and distance of these stars are related by a simple mathematical Using all he calculated distances of nine different We live in a fairly typical spiral containing vast numbers of The stars are very far away from so we can only observe their one characteristic their When this light is passed through a it gives rise to a Every star has its own and since each element has its own unique we can measure a light spectra to know its chemical We use thermal spectra of the stars to know their In when scientists were examining spectra of different they found that some of the characteristic lines of the star spectrum were shifted towards the red end of the The implications of this phenomenon were given by the Doppler and it was clear that many galaxies were moving away from It was assumed since some galaxies are red some galaxies would also be blue redshifted galaxies far outnumbered blueshifted Hubble found that the amount of redshift is directly proportional to relative From he determined that the Universe is expanding and had a Despite the concept of a static Universe persisted into the 20th Einstein was so sure of a static Universe that he developed the and introduced forces to allow a universe of infinite age to many astronomers also tried to avoid the implications of general relativity and stuck with their static with one especially notable the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann made two very simple the Universe is identical wherever we and that it is identical in every direction that we look His results showed that the Universe is His assumptions were later proved when two physicists at Bell Arno Penzias and Robert found unexpected microwave radiation not only from the one particular part of the sky but from everywhere and by nearly the same Thus first assumption was proved to be At around the same Robert Dicke and Jim Peebles were also working on microwave They argued that they should be able to see the glow of the early Universe as background microwave Wilson and Penzias had already done so they were awarded with the Nobel Prize in In our place in the Universe is not so we should see the Universe as approximately the same from any other part of which supports second His work remained largely unknown until similar models were made by Howard Robertson and Arthur model gave rise to three different types of models for the evolution of the the Universe would expand for a given amount of and if the expansion rate is less than the density of the Universe to gravitational it would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Universe at a later the Universe would and at some if the expansion rate and the density of the Universe became it would expand slowly and leading to a somewhat static the Universe would continue to expand if the density of the Universe is less than the critical amount required to balance the expansion rate of the The first model depicts the space of the Universe to be curved In the second the space would lead to a flat and the third model results in negative Even if we the current expansion rate is more than the critical density of the Universe including the dark matter and all the stellar The first model included the beginning of the Universe as a Big Bang from a space of infinite density and zero volume known as a point where the general theory of relativity solutions are based in also breaks This concept of the beginning of time by the Belgian Catholic priest Georges seemed originally to be motivated by religious because of its support of the biblical claim of the universe having a beginning in time instead of being Stephen Hawking puts it in his people do not like the idea that time has a probably because it smacks of divine Catholic on the other seized on the big bang model and in 1951 officially pronounced it to be in accordance with the So a new theory was the state by Hermann Thomas and Fred to compete with the Big Bang Its predictions also matched with the current Universe But the fact that radio wave sources near us are far fewer than from the distant and there were numerous more radio sources than at resulted in the failure of this theory and universal acceptance of the Big Bang Evgeny Lifshitz and Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov also tried to find an alternative to the Big Bang theory but also Roger Penrose used light cones and general relativity to prove that a collapsing star could result in a region of zero size and infinite density and curvature called a Black Hawking and Penrose proved together that the Universe should have arisen from a which Hawking himself disproved once quantum effects are taken into In this Hawking first discusses French mathematician strong belief in scientific where scientific laws will eventually be able to accurately predict the future of the Then he discusses the theory of infinite radiation of stars according to the calculations of British scientists Lord Rayleigh and James which was later revised in 1900 by German scientist Max Planck who suggested that energy must radiate in finite packets called Hawking then discusses the uncertainty principle formulated by German scientist Werner according to which the speed and the position of a particle cannot be precisely known due to quantum increasing the accuracy in measuring its speed will decrease the certainty of its position and vice This disproved idea of a completely deterministic theory of the Hawking then describes the eventual development of quantum mechanics by Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger and English physicist Paul Dirac in the a theory which introduced an irreducible element of unpredictability into and despite German scientist Albert strong it has been proven to be very successful in describing the universe except for gravity and Hawking then discusses how uncertainty principle implies the duality behaviour of light particles in He then describes the phenomenon of interference where multiple light waves interfere with each other to give rise to a single light wave with properties different from those of the component as well as the interference within exemplified by the Hawking writes how interference refined our understanding of the structure of the building blocks of While Danish scientist Niels theory only partially solved the problem of collapsing quantum mechanics completely resolved According to American scientist Richard sum over histories is a nice way of visualizing the Hawking mentions that general theory of relativity is a quantum theory which ignores the uncertainty principle and that it has to be reconciled with quantum theory in situations where gravity is very such as black holes and the Big In this Hawking traces the history of investigation about the nature of four notion of indivisible John ideas about atoms combining to form discovery of electrons inside Ernest discovery of atomic nucleus and James discovery of neutrons and finally Murray work on even smaller quarks which make up protons and Hawking then discusses the six different and and three different of quarks and Later in the chapter he discusses which are outnumbered by quarks due to the expansion and cooling of the Hawking then discusses the spin property of which determines what a particle looks like from different Hawking then discusses two groups of particles in the Universe based on their fermions and with a spin of follow the Pauli exclusion which states that they cannot share the same quantum state two protons cannot occupy the same location in Without this complex structures could not Bosons or the with a spin of or do not follow the exclusion Hawking then gives the examples of virtual gravitons and virtual Virtual with a spin of carry the force of Virtual with a spin of carry the electromagnetic Hawking then discusses the weak nuclear force for radioactivity and affecting mainly and the strong nuclear force carried by the particle which binds quarks together into usually neutrons and and also binds neutrons and protons together into atomic Hawking then writes about the phenomenon called color confinement which prevents the discovery of quarks and gluons on their own at extremely high as they remain confined within Hawking writes that at extremely high the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force behave as a single electroweak giving rise to the speculation that at even higher the electroweak force and strong nuclear force would also behave as a single Theories which attempt to describe the behaviour of this force are called Grand Unified which may help us explain many of the mysteries of physics that scientists have yet to In this Hawking discusses black regions of spacetime where extremely strong gravity prevents including from escaping from within Hawking describes how most black holes are formed during the collapse of massive stars least 25 times heavier than the approaching end of He writes about the event the black boundary from which no particle can escape to the rest of Hawking then discusses rotating black holes with spherical symmetry and rotating ones with Hawking then describes how astronomers discover a black hole not but by observing with special telescopes the powerful emitted when it consumes a Hawking ends the chapter by mentioning his famous bet made in 1974 with American physicist Kip Thorne in which Hawking argued that black holes did not Hawking lost the bet as new evidence proved that Cygnus was indeed a black This chapter discusses an aspect of black hole that Stephen Hawking discovered in the According to earlier black holes can only become and never because nothing which enters a black hole can come in Hawking published a new theory which argued that black holes can He imagined what might happen if a pair of virtual particles appeared near the edge of a black Virtual particles briefly energy from spacetime then annihilate with each returning the borrowed energy and ceasing to at the edge of a black one virtual particle might be trapped by the black hole while the other Because of the second law of particles are from taking energy from the the particle takes energy from the black hole instead of from the and escape from the black hole as Hawking According to black holes must very slowly shrink over time and eventually because of this rather than continue existing forever as scientists had previously Big Bang and the evolution of the Universe The beginning and the end of the universe are discussed in this Most scientists agree that the Universe began in an expansion called the At the start of the Big the Universe had an extremely high which prevented the formation of complex structures like or even very simple ones like During the Big a phenomenon called took in which the Universe briefly expanded to a much larger Inflation explains some characteristics of the Universe that had previously greatly confused After the universe continued to expand at a slower It became much eventually allowing for the formation of such Hawking also discusses how the Universe might have appeared differently if it grew in size slower or faster than it actually For if the Universe expanded too it would and there would not be enough time for life to If the Universe expanded too it would have become almost Hawking ultimately proposes the conclusion that the universe might be but In other it may have no beginning nor ending in but merely exist with a finite amount of matter and The concept of quantum gravity is also discussed in this In this chapter Hawking talks about why as Hawking calls time as humans observe and experience it contrast to which Hawking claims is inherent to the laws of seems to have a certain notably from the past towards the Hawking then discusses three of in his give time this first arrow of time is the thermodynamic arrow of the direction in which entropy Hawking calls According to this is why we never see the broken pieces of a cup gather themselves together to form a whole second arrow is the psychological arrow of whereby our subjective sense of time seems to flow in one which is why we remember the past and not the Hawking claims that our brain measures time in a way where disorder increases in the direction of time we never observe it working in the opposite In other he claims that the psychological arrow of time is intertwined with the thermodynamic arrow of third and final arrow of time is the cosmological arrow of the direction of time in which the Universe is expanding rather than According to during a contraction phase of the the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time would not Hawking then claims that the boundary for the universe implies that the universe will expand for some time before contracting back He goes on to argue that the no boundary proposal is what drives entropy and that it predicts the existence of a thermodynamic arrow of time if and only if the universe is as it implies that the universe must have started in a smooth and ordered state that must grow toward disorder as time He argues because of the no boundary a contracting universe would not have a thermodynamic arrow and therefore only a Universe which is in an expansion phase can support intelligent Using the weak anthropic Hawking goes on to argue that the thermodynamic arrow must agree with the cosmological arrow in order for either to be observed by intelligent in is why humans experience these three arrows of time going in the same In this Hawking discusses whether it is possible to time travel into the future or the He shows how physicists have attempted to devise possible methods by humans with advanced technology may be able to travel faster than the speed of or travel backwards in and these concepts have become mainstays of science bridges were proposed early in the history of general relativity These would appear identical to black holes from the but matter which entered would be relocated to a different location in potentially in a distant region of or even backwards in later research demonstrated that such a even if possible for it to form in the first would not allow any material to pass through before turning back into a regular black The only way that a wormhole could theoretically remain and thus allow travel or time would require the existence of exotic matter with negative energy which violates the energy conditions of general As almost all physicists agree that light travel and travel backwards in time are not Hawking also describes his own protection which provides a more formal explanation for why and backwards time travel are almost certainly Quantum field theory and general relativity describe the physics of the Universe with astounding accuracy within their own domains of these two theories contradict each For the uncertainty principle of QFT is incompatible with This and the fact that QFT and GR do not fully explain observed have led physicists to search for a theory of that is both internally consistent and explains observed phenomena just as well as or better than existing theories Hawking is cautiously optimistic that such a unified theory of the Universe may be found in spite of significant At the time the book was had emerged as the most popular theory of quantum but this theory and related string theories were still incomplete and had yet to be proven in spite of significant effort remains the case as of String theory proposes that particles behave like rather than as dimensionless particles as they do in These strings in many Instead of 3 dimensions as in QFT or 4 dimensions as in superstring theory requires a total of 10 The nature of the six dimensions required by superstring theory are difficult if not impossible to leaving countless theoretical string theory landscapes which each describe a universe with different Without a means to narrow the scope of it is likely impossible to find practical applications for string Alternative theories of quantum such as loop quantum similarly suffer from a lack of evidence and difficulty to Hawking thus proposes three there exists a complete unified theory that we will eventually the overlapping characteristics of different landscapes will allow us to gradually explain physics more accurately with time and there is no ultimate The third possibility has been sidestepped by acknowledging the limits set by the uncertainty The second possibility describes what has been happening in physical sciences so with increasingly accurate partial Hawking believes that such refinement has a limit and that by studying the very early stages of the Universe in a laboratory a complete theory of Quantum Gravity will be found in the 21st century allowing physicists to solve many of the currently unsolved problems in In this final Hawking summarises the efforts made by humans through their history to understand the Universe and their place in starting from the belief in anthropomorphic spirits controlling followed by the recognition of regular patterns in and finally with the scientific advancement in recent the inner workings of the universe have become far better He recalls the suggestion of the French mathematician Laplace that the structure and evolution could eventually be precisely explained by a set of laws whose origin is left in Hawking states that the uncertainty principle introduced by the quantum theory in the twentieth century has set limits to the predictive accuracy of future laws to be Hawking comments that the study of cosmology study of the and end of Earth and the Universe as a has been primarily motivated by a search for philosophical and religious for to better understand the nature of or even whether God exists at for most scientists today who work on these theories approach them with mathematical calculation and empirical rather than asking such philosophical In his the increasingly technical nature of these theories have caused modern cosmology to become increasingly divorced from philosophical Hawking nonetheless expresses hope that one day everybody would talk about these theories in order to understand the true origin and nature of the and accomplish ultimate triumph of human The first edition included an introduction

leaving the UA Jordan ran into another UA an acquaintance who had managed Ike Tina and told him about message and The acquaintance took Jordan into his and the two of them then called Lauder in As a two weeks later Jordan was in where Lauder and British UA told him that they could offer the Groovies a contract right then as long as the band temporarily moved to which Jordan agreed to One of the reasons for moving the band was the opportunity to work with British Dave Edmunds at Rockfield in we heard version Hear You in the sound on the record was so great that we thought Rockfield was the

decided to show up to meet the Groovies and see if he actually wanted to work with The knowing nothing about spent about three hours asking Edmunds questions about his own one of which prompted the

said that was at the same point as I was with Kama Sutra and Epic prior major get rid of these guys and get with someone Jordan and Wilson had pushed for Some and Tore Me to be issued as those two along with the cover were never issued at all by and the Groovies ended up owning the master tapes to these three UA had objected to Some because of its almost and so Edmunds produced a version slightly speeding the song up and so making it almost 30 seconds but UA also turned this version Back in the US in Jordan produced a version that was only about minutes but that version was then also turned down by In the Groovies allowed Greg Records to release the Rockfield version of Tore Me as a and in 1975 Shaw was able to sign the group to Sire Sire owner Seymour who loved production the

wondered whether they could find a starting point in fable The Ant and the Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the In Walt Disney Feature Animation had considered producing a film in the entitled Army that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic but this never fully As Stanton and Ranft discussed the they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their Lasseter liked the idea and offered some The concept simmered until early when the story team began work on the second film in During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and 159 Lasseter assigned the job to both worked well together and had similar Lasseter had realized that working on a feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in In Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead In The Ant and the a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the when winter the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for but the ants turn him Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the

would instead stay and He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second Bugs DVD Commentary Although the film was already far Stanton concluded that the story needed a different Stanton took one of the early circus bug Red the red and changed him into the character The Circus no longer out to cheat the would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting Lasseter agreed with this new and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with 161 The characters and were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in

appearance of actor Roddy who played dying shortly before the theatrical It was more difficult for animators during the production of A Life than that of Toy as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising Rich Quade and Glenn to assist with directing and reviewing the The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with Wall of Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was likely to After Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world

Buzz with the other toys serving mostly as A Life required storytelling for several major groups of Character design also presented a new in that the designers had to make ants appear Although the animators and the art department studied insects more natural realism would give way to the larger 162 The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two The in received a pair of extra appendages to appear less The scale also required software engineers to accommodate new Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant some with as many as It was impractical for animators to control them but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing or move Bill one of the two supervising technical dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual Each one of these would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways different color of eye or different different This ensured that no two ants were the It was partly based on invention of particle systems a decade and a half which had let animators use masses of particles to create effects like swirling dust and 163 The animators also employed subsurface by Pixar Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the render surfaces in a more lifelike This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the Game was attached alongside A Life in its theatrical During the production of A a public feud erupted between Jeffrey and Steve Jobs and John former chairman of film had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael In he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in After acquisition of Pacific Data Images contemporary in computer and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that first project at DreamWorks would be another ant to be called 170 By this project was well known within the animation 171 Both Antz and A Life center on a young male a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a hand by saving their Whereas A Life relied chiefly on visual Antz was more verbal and revolved more around The script of Antz was also heavy with adult whereas film was more accessible to It was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney often calling to check In October when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal Technicolor facility in Universal where DreamWorks was also he called Katzenberg and dropped by with When Katzenberg asked what they were doing Lasseter described what would become A Life in Lasseter respected judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative 169 Lasseter had high hopes for Toy and he was telling friends throughout the animation business to get cracking on their own He told various this going to be like space movies after Star for computer animation Lasseter later should have been Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be When the trades indicated production on feeling called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were who in turn asked him where he had heard the Lasseter asked and Katzenberg admitted it was Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe story that a development director had pitched him the idea long Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October Another source gives Nina one of as the person responsible for the Antz who normally did not use profane cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was to get and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in fight with For his Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a Eisner had decided not to pay him his convincing board not to give him Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of which was then intended to be first animated Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg moved the opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a was that Katzenberg had given PDI financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready despite head Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began Katzenberg made an He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Jobs believed it blatant extortion and would not go for explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long explaining that Jobs had come to rescue by making the deal for Toy as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that Katzenberg was the one guy there for you back and now allowing them to use you to screw He suggested that if Jobs wanted he could simply slow down production on A Life without telling If he Katzenberg he would put Antz on Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the but Katzenberg denied these charges 172 As the release dates for both films Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a of A who claimed to have never seen told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see 174 Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press bad guys rarely Jobs told the Los Angeles In head of marketing Terry Press Jobs should take a Despite the successful box office performance of both Antz and A tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many According to Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of Shrek and insisted he had never heard

the realm of the study of philosophy through the scope of The essay attempts to define knowledge by connecting beliefs and knowledge through underlying and connective series called causal It provides a causal theory of A causal chain is repeatedly described as a sequence of events for which one event in a chain causes the According to these chains can only exist with the presence of an accepted a belief in the and a cause for the subject to believe the The essay also explores the ideas of perception and memory through the use of the causal chains and the concept of essay is regarded as an improvement and rebuttal of Edmund Justified True Belief which is one of many attempts to explain the necessary conditions for knowledge to Goldman implements the causal connection to reiterate his own theory of Knowledge says if and only if the belief is justified by a reaction to the accepted theory later counters that of Michael stating that his own theory including figures and diagrams is more appropriate than Causal Theory of uses figures which make explicit references to causal model does not utilize these and Goldman states that the lack of these arrows deems model currently a

cognitive Causal Theory of was first published paper explaining his own views of Goldman has written more than ten essays focusing on knowledge and cognitive essay starts with a definition of followed by multiple reiterations of the idea of causal figures to explain knowledge through a visual and references to perception and memory through causal The essay tends to focus on examples in which knowledge or other sensations do not rather than proving a certain fact to be Goldman also states on multiple occasions that he does not wish to explain the causal process in instead pointing out At numerous times in the he also points out that he does not intend to give definitive answers to each of the propositions Goldman also refocuses the idea of or knowledge through sensation using his own theory of The concept of causal perception indicates that one observes something only if the object itself causes the sensation of sight to be accepted as the existence must be factual and one must believe its While all knowledge comes from inferred knowledge emerges when physical object facts cause sense data which can be perceived as The sense data can also be used to make known as inferred about certain physical object From Causal Theory of Goldman constructs the idea that memory is also a causal Memory is explained as being an extension of knowledge into the and remembering is the act of recalling a fact that has already been the theory states that if knowledge is forgotten at one it cannot be considered a memory in the According to if a fact is known at Time 1 but forgotten at Time and then at Time 3 that the fact is perceived again but not at Time 3 the original fact is not a memory because there is no causal connection between the fact and the A Cause to Kill or Sha Ji is

the Bridewell Palace in and Harman was clearly acquainted with developments in law enforcement The Caveat is dedicated to Bess of although that does not mean that she was known personally to There are literary precursors to the including John The Fraternity of Vagabonds of which Harman was It was written in a period when the government in England was increasingly concerned with the perceived problem of Solutions were being sought to the issue of the In the Statute of Artificers was passed banish Poor Laws were under and a plethora of laws passed against in which the punishments ranged from whipping to In there was a proposal from a committee Privy to restore an act of 1547 that provided for slavery as a set out a taxonomy of which expanded one sketched out by The structure and processes of this mirrored those of Tudor with its hierarchy and sumptuary and the trade with their apprenticeships and initiations An example is the ceremony of a which Harman In this an Upright Man pours beer over the head of the with the do stall to the and that henceforth it shall be lawful for you to cant for thy living in all Such a ceremony is reproduced in later rogue and in the play The Beggars Bush by Fletcher and from which it was extracted by Francis Kirkman in The Bampfylde Moore Carew includes a similar account of his own inauguration as King of the and there was a tradition that the graves of members of the Boswell gypsy family were visited annually and beer poured onto them during the eighteenth and nineteenth Although his taxonomy has been read as if these roles were examples made it clear that many of these roles were modes of begging or crime adopted by the same vagabond from time to They also make it clear that many of these villains also had legitimate which they exercised from time to This is confirmed by the historical which shows that many of those arrested as vagrants were unemployed through no fault of their They included domestic servants who had been labourers seeking or those whose trade required such as pedlars and chapmen Harman does seem to have had direct contact with while most of those who wrote later rogue literature were London based writers living in literary Another area in which Harman has been misunderstood is the place of Egyptians in this vagabond They have no specific place in and although he identifies a few individuals as being he describes them generally as having a distinct culture and This is consistent with the attitude to them that they were little understood therefore criminal or at least a danger to the social The attitude to the Irish seems to have been though less The following is summarised from with comments in Abram Men or Feign madness and claim to have been inmates at there was an Abraham If they are

with Counterfeit Cranks Pretend to suffer from the They wear dirty and carry soap so they can use it to foam at the Some carry false testimonials from ministers in This is one of the modes adopted by Nicholas Demanders for Glimmer Beggars pretending to have suffered loss by carrying counterfeit Harman says most of these are who collect and which they and able to earn 6 or 7 a They worked with Upright but were careful not to be seen with Dells Female rogues who are still Harman says they are either born to or have lost their parents or been run away from service with some A Doxy A female rogue whose virginity has been taken by an Upright They are dependent on Upright Men and other objection is to their promiscuous He remarks that their breeches serve a dual as they are also used to carry food they are Dummerers Beggars pretending most of whom Harman says came from He recounts having satisfied himself that a license produced by one of these was he and a surgeon hung him by his wrists from a beam until he Harman took his money and distributed it to the and the dummerer and his palliard were taken before a pilloried and Fraters Pretending to be factors or proctors with false licenses to collect alms for Hooker or Angler They carry a long staff and go to houses seeking charity during the day to see what may be After dark they return and use an iron stick with a hook at the end to reach in through windows to steal clothes and which they hide nearby before taking it to Jarkmen or Patricos Harman says that although Awdeley refers these neither A Jarkman is supposed to be a forger of but Harman says that these are not made by as he has never come across one capable of writing well but bought by them in what can not be had for is probably Several false licenses and the historical evidence is that they were mostly produced by provincial who were notoriously poorly There does seem to have been a real market for with the price determined by the content and quality of the license and the current ferocity of law Harman accepts that was the cant word for but says they did not have priests or any ceremony of as few were preferring fellowship and good Kinchin Coves Young male Harman allows them no prospect of he groweth unto he is better to hang than draw Kinchin Morts Young female rogues carried on their back in Palliards Also known as They travel in patched

Harman says that after a year or two they become Upright they prevented by twisted The word was used in a 1535 Tudor Act against Swadders or Pedlars Harman all be but of an indifferent His objection is that some bribe and and provide outlets for stolen goods which they are given by Upright Tinkers or Priggs Harman does not condemn all only those who steal and spend their money on He says they

introduction to and justification for the Statute of Labourers in Walking Morts Unmarried female who live by or but their goods are taken by Upright Harman recounts a conversation with one in which he

grandfather had been he must needs be one by good Harman includes a short dictionary of cant His introduction to that is characteristic of his literary style and social I set before the good reader the lousy language of these loitering lusks and lazy wherewith they buy and sell the common people as they pass through the The value of the dictionary to the was probably Cant has only been found in court records six all after Harman and and the extent to which it was actually used is it was a goldmine for later who various copied expanded on or used it to add colour to pamphlets and taxonomy is

Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Harman claimed that having for twenty years kept a house on the main road to and having through sickness been at his home he had learned how to extract information from those vagabonds who called seeking His accounts show similarities to the depositions taken by Justices of the Peace examining and have been assumed to have been the same kind of first hand account collected by researchers such as Henry Harman is not a disinterested observer or He regards himself as a skilled and the information to have been extracted against the will of those providing Although there is no suggestion he did so he approvingly reports his own use of violence to extract a confession in one He justifies his expansion of work by saying it was insufficient to protect His work is

in Whitefriars on All Hallows Day 1566 seeking naked from the waist in ragged dirty his face smeared with fresh blood feigning the palsy or Being suspicious Harman questioned and Blunt claimed to have been suffering from the falling sickness for eight and to have been discharged from Bedlam two weeks after being an inmate there two Harman checked with the keeper of the hospital who denied and then
