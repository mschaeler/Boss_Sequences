all
the
kings
servants
and
the
people
of
the
kings
provinces
know
that
if
any
man
or
woman
goes
to
the
king
inside
the
inner
court
without
being
called
there
is
but
one
lawto
be
put
to
death
except
the
one
to
whom
the
king
holds
out
the
golden
scepter
so
that
he
may
live
but
as
for
me
i
have
not
been
called
to
come
in
to
the
king
these
thirty
days
