All we children cried.
The old man and the old woman didn't say nothing, because they was scared.

"We had no skillet at that time.
We would rake the fireplace and push the ashes back and then you would put the cake down on the hearth or on a piece of paper or a leaf and then pull the ashes over the cake to cook it.

But then I'm tellin' you the truth about it.
"When our hogs was taken that time, we didn't have nothing to go on that winter.

Wasn't no way to get nothing.

In the daytime, they would fix traps and jerk a string and pull a board down on them and then go out in the weeds and get them.
I never reported nothin' to the police.
I wasn't able to report nothing.
I was just batching, and now and then people would come in and report them to me.
They would wait till they saw somebody come in and when they saw that I was talking and wouldn't notice them, they would steal anything they wanted.
