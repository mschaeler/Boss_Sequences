As he heard, the Abbot raised his eyebrows and looked somewhat disapproving, when he realized that the peasant lad who had dared to put his page into the beautiful book was the same little colour-grinder who had had the boldness to speak to him, one day in the garden, and ask him to take off Brother Stephen's chain.
However, whatever he may have thought, he kept it to himself; he treated the messenger with much courtesy, and, on bidding him good night, invited him to stay as a guest of the Abbey so long as he chose.
The next morning the messenger rode to the Viaud farm, and, though he did not go into the cottage, he looked it over carefully and the land about it; and then he took the highway that led to the castle of Count Pierre de Bouchage.
When he reached the castle, he asked to see Count Pierre, and so was taken into the great hall, where the count received him in a very haughty manner.
He became somewhat more polite, however, when he learned that King Louis had sent the messenger to him; though he looked decidedly blank when the latter presented to him a letter written on parchment and fastened with a wax seal stamped with the king's emblem, which was the print of a little porcupine with the quills on his back standing up straight, and a crown on top of them.
On seeing this letter, Count Pierre looked blank because the truth was, that, like many other noble lords at that time, he could read only with great difficulty.
The young ladies had little idea what harm they were doing with their songs.
David himself was delighted with the praise these young women intended, as we might expect he would be; but, as the towering King rode on he became angry, saying to himself while spurring ahead on his horse, "What more can I have but this kingdom itself?"
Therefore the King watched David from that day forward, to see whether, perhaps, he intended to become the king.
King Saul's depression came back again from time to time, and, each day David stood before him, playing upon his harp and singing the king's praises; but, now Saul did not care to listen.
This music of David's did not make him feel better as it had before, but rather it made him feel worse, due to the fact that he supposed his youthful chief would try to take over and therefore loathed seeing him or seeing him play.
Much to the contrary, the king's friends thought David's music was exactly the thing that would replenish the king's health.
The dark faced king was never without a weapon near his hand; and, holding his long spear he would just sit and listen to the young harper; now pleased, now angry, for he sometimes liked David and sometimes he didn't.
Two times he seized a small spear and threw it at him, at the same time proclaiming that it would trap him against the wall; but, he would miss his target.
Even if he meant no harm to David, David steered clear of the spear and was certain to leave when the King began flinging his spear around.
During a time of mental duress the King rather quickly grew most afraid of this young captain.
Hoping to get him out of view, he secured a group of warrior men equaling one thousand and told him to live together with them somewhere further away.
This only gained more popularity for David, as these men liked him more than even the others before had liked him.
At this point King Saul distinctly hoped that David would die.
He hated him so ferociously that he decided to have him killed.
He should not do the killing himself, that would not be wise.
So, he presented David the offer of his daughter Merab, to be his wife, if first he would go to Philistine and fight the Philistine warriors.
The sly King Saul supposed that this way the Philistines just might kill David.
Alas, David did not wish to marry Merab, although, he did love a good fight.
So, he took off to fight the Philistines, only to return alive.
At this point the King broke his word about his daughter's betrothal to David.
Instead of David, King Saul bequeathed his daughter to another who in turn responded with a gift as was the custom when celebrating weddings.
This did not bother David, since Merab had a little sister Michal who he loved very much and she truly loved the noble and fearless young chief, as well.
Hearing of the love of his younger daughter for David, the King assumed that David would take even greater risks for her hand at marriage.
The King sent David a message that he was satisfied and also pleased with his doings and wished for him to marry his younger daughter.
To take the place of the customary gift David, being quite poor, could conquer one hundred Philistines by a decreed time and be assured that this would be equal in value to a present.
It is not known what the younger daughter, Michal felt like about this unlikely deal.
It was apparent that Saul was asking too much, as he hoped that the arrangement would result in David's being killed.
David, although, was delighted with the idea.
Lord Bacon outstrectched his arms to celebrate the blooming fields before him.

And the small red flowers, christened by the locals as, wincopipe.

Economic Liberation   1.
Why Organize?
In this world, from its all four sides, echo is compelling the mankind to be well co operated for any kind of general fruitful advantages.
Even though this current world is fully contaminated with unending struggles and quarrel some situations, in its another side, it is always longing le lead a life without strain and it is aiming to be relieved from all such grievances and from the present day conflict.
You can guess that this world will be growing well by its extreme lines of productive activity.
It will be meeting out all its requirements adequately form world economic organization.
Also it will be shining naturally with more powerful resources such as natural resources, raw materials, transport facilities, credit, and its general huge phase of production and consumption.
But in fact there are some unavoidable little differences existing about the necessary elements of such organizations.
Perhaps, you can raise a question well about the probability of developments of a vast world machine.
You may desire to know the result of such ultimate purposes.
You can doubt very much about the human beingâs greatest efforts regarding the improvement of the economic and political structure of human society.

But if you think carefully and cautiously, you can easily have a cleat cut answer for all of your above mentioned doubts.
Commonly man king will be always longing for continuous changes and improvements in their existing economic life.
The reason for such desire is they will be also longing for attaining great freedom and they will always try to organize them for the purpose of making these changes and improvements more easily.
Usually man in his original nature is completely subject to many extreme limitations.
First he will aim for his physical limitations such as his own bodyâs height, destination, flexibility, resistance, its fund of energy etc.
then he will try to have limitations on nature such as by the climate, the altitude, the fertility of the soil, the deposits of minerals, the movement of water etc.
thirdly he would like to be limited with some other social matters such as habit, custom, tradition and opinions of his friends and neighbors that is society.
Moreover, he will try to be limited by some other things like prejudice, ignorance, fear, cowardice and also by his own lack of perfect understanding for the true nature of freedom.
Bye the bye, apart from all above restrictions, finally he will come to be bonded with his social economic bonds which will be included with his employment for their day to day bread, clothing, and shelter for comfort and luxury.
THE SKEPTIC'S POINT OF VIEW ON THE RESULT OF IGNORANCE.
"Forgetfulness happening once can be noticed at times in places where you would not expect to find it; they young mind being educated and to process an endeavor of scientific inquiry, these are two things which are easily distinguished; the education demands faith, and the scientific inquiry requires doubt; education is the work of the church and science is the work of people.
Althou the Duke of Somerset attends church, and discovers on ignorant group of people calm in a delightful place of false perception, all the while the more educated of the people are skeptical to these new ideas.
The pastors now cheer to faith in vain.
*** The Protestant usually reads his Bible; he tries and wishes to believe.
*** Nothing is accomplished from these efforts."
Christian Theology and Modern Skepticism, 1872 p.144.
"The Protestant and the Duke are plainly trying to at once do two things, and of course, Professor Huxley is also tempted to do this."
Lay Sermons p. 21 "But then keen enough is he to think something unreasonable in the position, and to realisticly says that the army of liberal thinking is currently not in tight order; and many liberal thinkers use this freedom to espress ludicrous thoughts"  Lay Sermons p.69 To be skeptical is to have wisdom, and ignorance is bliss according to the named quotations.
Give me a calm place of false perceptions; " Let me confide in them; if I am let down in the end I shall end up the same as the skeptic, with this being the difference, and if there is a hereafter, i will be aware that in my ignorance I lived a blessed life which included reference to the currently experienced eternity;but, just in case the hereafter does not exist, equal we shall be.
I say it again, give me the angle where I have no risks to take when looked at from the skeptic's point of view and where I can "confide in a calm place of false perceptions," in preference to the skeptic's annoying nonbelief.
